# Incorporating Large Language Models into the Computer Science Curriculum at BYU.
This repository includes an analysis of how to prepare students to develop skills that will equip them to complete in an environment where most industry programmers use LLMs in their workflow.

Mark Clement experimented with using claude to create a voting system (front end, back end and database) in 30 minutes.  He then tried using Gemini.  After 4 hours he gave up.  Claude installs everything for you, Gemini gives you instructions on how to install things yourself.  There were version problems and it seemed like students would have a difficult time using Gemini.  Eric Ringger indicated that his research indicates that Claude is a long way ahead of Gemini, Chat, Copilot in pair programming capabilities.  Our recommendation is that we introduce students to the best platform available rather than pinching a penny and providing student with a difficult to use framework.
